      <h1>Weapon Background</h1>
      <p>The UMP (Universale Maschinenpistole, German for "Universal Submachine Gun") is a submachine gun 
      developed and manufactured by Heckler & Koch. The UMP is a blowback-operated select-fire submachine gun firing from a closed bolt. 
      It features a polymer stock that is able to be folded for compactness, a paddle-style magazine release, and a handguard that is able to accept accessories, 
      such as vertical foregrips. The barrel is approximately 8 inches long, and there may be rails on top of the receiver to mount optics.</p>
      <p>As originally designed, the UMP is chambered for larger cartridges (.45 ACP and .40 S&W) than other submachine guns like the MP5,
       to provide more stopping power against unarmored targets (with slightly lower effectiveness at longer range) than the MP5 (largely offered in 9Ã—19mm, 
       albeit with short-lived production of 10mm Auto and .40 S&W variants). A larger cartridge produces more recoil, and makes control more difficult in fully automatic firing. To mitigate this, 
       the cyclic rate of fire was reduced to 600 rounds/min, which makes it one of the slower firing submachine guns on the market.</p>

       <h1>Trivia</h1>
       <p>In Deep Dive, both UMP45 and UMP40 are implied to be DSI-8 model T-Dolls manufactured by Sangvis Ferri, which were stolen and heavily modified with a set of enhanced electronic warfare 
       suites and sold to Griffin and Kryuger. Due to the illegal modification, neither of the two could be fitted with fire control cores and were assigned weak SMGs thanks to their poor marksmanship.
        By the time 45 first appears in the story, she's taught herself how to aim properly without a fire control core and has taken command of her own mercenary/black ops team.</p>
