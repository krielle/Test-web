      <h1>Weapon Background</h1>
      <p>After the introduction and successful market sales of MP5, Heckler & Koch continued to develop selective firing close quarter combat SMGs, one of the development outcome and the official successor to MP5 is the UMP (Universale Maschinenpistole) series.</p>
      <p>UMP SMGs are selective fire, recoil operated and fires from a closed bolt, featuring three main variants which are designed to fire 9x19mm Parabellum, .45 ACP and .40 S&W. Compared to the older MP5 model, UMP was advertised to be more reliable, more modern and lower cost, 
      other common features of the UMP SMGs are Picatinny rails placements (Along the top of the gun, both sides and bottom of the barrel) and a foldable buttstock.</p>
      <p>As the name signifies, UMP9 is the variant chambered for 9x19mm Parabellum calibre, like the other two main variants, UMP9 also features a 2-round burst fire mode, together with semi-automatic and fully automatic. UMP9 is able to achieve 600 to 650 rounds per minute of cyclic rate of fire, 
      while fed by a 30-round capacity curved magazine, effective firing range is around 100m with a 200mm long barrel.</p>
      <p>UMP9 is the lighter one of the three main UMP variants, weighting 2.3 kilograms unloaded, which is almost 0.2 kilograms lighter than the 9mm MP5 SMG UMP9 is aimed to replace. Light weight is achieved by the weapon's polymer build material, polymer built frames are also more resistant to corrosion. 
      Similar to UMP45, UMP9 is widely exported and found in service in various military, special forces and law enforcement organizations around the world.</p>

       <h1>Trivia</h1>
       <p>The scar over the right eye was intentionally left not repaired by 9, a similar scar over the opposite eye can be found on her sister UMP45. 45 obtained her scar over the left eye in combat, there are no solid explanation so far on in the story regarding 9's scar. It is highly unlikely that she obtained 
       such a precisely located scar during the same incident, perhaps she intentionally slashed it herself in attempt to get closer to her sister.</p>
       <p>Her sister UMP45 has a fore-grip attachment on her weapon while 9 does not, it is suggested that 9's weapon lacking a fore-grip attachment reflects her personality and her position within a squad, claiming that she is unable to (or less able to) 'handle' situations compared to her sister 45(没有把握). 
       Such claim is further supported by 9's story interaction, various points in the story where she shows lacking of confidence to a degree of panicking when she had to take command and be in charge, after her sister was forced out of action.</p>
