      <h1>History</h1>
      <p class="lead">Pre-Infection</p>
      <p>The world of Girls' Frontline takes place in an alternate history, where the Russian Empire accidentally stumbled upon an ancient alien ruin located deep in 
      the Siberian taiga in the early 20th century. Although the alien technology found at the site was far beyond human comprehension at the time, the Russians 
      managed to keep the existence of the ruin a secret and began to extract some of the alien artifacts. This inadvertently caused the reactor within the alien construct 
      to destabilize, and ultimately led to the explosion known as the Tunguska event. Not long afterwards, the Bolshevik Revolution would topple the Empire, leaving the remaining alien constructs within the hands of Soviet Russia.</p>
      <p>World War II would happen a few decades later, with the Allies triumphant against the Axis in both the Western and Pacific Theaters. Having emerged as the two reigning superpowers, 
      the United States and the Soviet Union eagerly took their war reparations. Much of the Axis's manufacturing and natural resources would end up in the hands of the US, but the Soviet Union 
      secretly took control of all the alien technology that Germany possessed- including the alien research facility Urkunde 01. A Cold War soon breaks out between the United States and the Soviet Union, 
      with the latter quickly gaining the upper hand in both nuclear arms technology as well as alien research. By 1950, the Soviets had begun the first concentrated effort to research and synthesize alien 
      tech with Project Starfish. The United States finally discovers the existence of precursor ruins five years later, beginning their own research at a ruin named D-1.</p>
      <p class="lead">Cold War</p>
      <p>As research into alien technology ramps up, the first precursor corpse is found in the Beilan Island Ruins, located in the North China Sea near Shanghai. Named GAVIRUL, experiments and research into 
      precursor biology begins nearly immediately. However, improper handling of the ruins leads to a rupture in some alien storage tanks. The results of this leak are almost immediately apparent as workers in 
      the area quickly succumb to the effects of an otherworldly disease. Called Eurosky Low-Emission Infectious Disease (ELID), the mutations are quickly found to be caused by interaction between collapse fluid and human biology, 
      and the entire site is closed down before ultimately being sealed off by the local government.</p>
      <p class="lead">Beilan Island Incident</p>
      <p>In 2030, an incident occurs at the Beilan Island containment site as a group of seven middle school students break into the ruins, and are attacked almost immediately by mutant ELID sufferers. A militia strike team is sent in to rescue the group, 
      but the squad is quickly overwhelmed and forced to use explosives to ensure that the mutants don't break containment. The explosion destroys the entrance to the ruin and succeeds in wiping out the mutants, but exposes the facility to open air, ultimately 
      resulting in a huge volume of collapse fluid contaminating Earth's atmosphere, spreading via trade winds and rendering a large portion of Earth's land uninhabitable. As a result, existing nations and superpowers were forced to reevaluate their circumstances and adapt quickly, 
      resulting in the formation of entities such as the Pan-European Union and the New Soviet Union.</p>
